# Learning Rust with "The Rust Programming Language"

This repository documents my journey of learning the Rust programming language by following the official book, ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to actively engage with the book's content by implementing the examples, exercises, and projects from each chapter. Each major project or concept has its own directory.

## Projects

Here are the projects completed so far:

- **Chapter 1: Getting Started**
  - `hello_world`: A simple "Hello, world!" program.
  - `hello_cargo`: The first project using Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager.
- **Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game**
  - `guessing_game`: An interactive guessing game that introduces fundamental Rust concepts like variables, types, I/O, and control flow.

## Usage

To run any of the Cargo-based projects, navigate to its directory and use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```
